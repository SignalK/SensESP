     systimediff: timediff in seconds between gps timestamp and system time that we allow before we set gps time
     settimeperiod: time in seconds befor we retry setting the systemtime

	 a device at the hubs first port will look like: 1-1.2.1:1.0 ,
	 at the second 1-1.2.2:1.0 - potentially you must check the logs
	 The below config uses a predefined device with this ID and 
	 room for 4 additional autodetect devices

	 We use autobaud between 4800 and 38400 here

      This stuff is "legacy" on systems that have udev support
      because for them we use the AVNUsbSerialReader
      But if we need to interface to some none usb-serial interfaces or run on a system without udev
      those configurations can be used
      Devices like /dev/rfcommn can be used for bluetooth connections setup outside of us...
