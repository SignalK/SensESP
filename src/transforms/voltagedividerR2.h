/**
 * A transform that uses the voltage divider formula to resolve the resistance
 * of R2 in the circuit, given a fixed voltage sent into the divider (Vin),
 * a known resistance an the junction of the two resistors (R1), and the
 * output of the divider (Vout).  This is the typical way a sensor such as
 * a temperature sender or oil pressure sender is wired up: the sender's resistance
 * varies based on temperature or pressure, so it is usually "R2" in a voltage
 * divider.  R1 and/or Vin is selected in such a way to ensure Vout (the value
 * read by the MCU's analog input) does not exceed 3.3 volts.
