/**
 * @brief The base class for all sensors. Used only as a base class - never
 * instantiated directly in a project.
 * 
 * In SensESP, a sensor is something that takes a measurement outside of the
 * SensESP / SignalK environment and brings it into SensESP. Look at the list
 * of files in https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP/tree/master/src/sensors for
 * all the already-defined sensors.
 * 
 * @param config_path The path that defines the place in the hierarchy of
 * variables, in the Config UI, that are configurable at run-time. If a class
 * has no configurable variables, or if you simply don't want any particular
 * variable to be configurable at run-time in your project, don't provide a
 * config_path when you construct the class.
