/**
 * @brief A high level transform designed to control a digital output
 * (such as a relay) via manual button presses or programatic commands.
 *
 * To accomplish this, the controller accepts inputs from a generic boolean
 * producer (usually a SignalK listener), as well as String and ClickType
 * inputs. The latter allows a physical button to control the load as well as
 * add special behaviors to the sensor application. In particular, a double
 * click can be configured to set the state of multiple signal k paths, and
 * an ultra long press of the button will cause the MCU to reboot.
 * <p>A SmartSwitchController object behaves differently depending on the type
 * of input it receives. If the input is a boolean or a "valid truth type"
 * (which is a specialized type of boolean - see below), SmartSwitchController's
 * output will be "on" if the input is "true", or "off" if the input is "false".
 * If the input is a ClickType, or a String that's NOT a "valid truth type",
 * SmartSwitchController's output will simply toggle the output back and forth
 * between "on" and "off" with each input. There are two exceptions to this if
 * the input is a ClickType:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A value of ClickTypes::DoubleClick will toggle the output as well as
 *       send PUT requests to synchronize zero or more paths that are configured
 * to do so</li> <li>A value of ClickTypes::UltraLongSingleClick will reboot the
 * MCU.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>Incoming String values are evaluated to see if they represent a "valid
 * truth type". Examples include "on", "ON", "off", "true", "false", "one", "1",
 * "123" (or any other string that represents a non-zero value), etc. Case is
 * insensitive. Any incoming String that doesn't evaluate to a "valid truth
 * type" will be treated as a "single click", and will toggle the output btween
 * "on" and "off".
 * @see TextToTruth
