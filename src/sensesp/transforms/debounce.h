/**
 * @brief Implements debounce code for a button or switch
 *
 * It's a passthrough transform that will output a value only if it's different
 * from the previous output, and only if it's been ms_min_delay ms since the
 * input was received.
 *
 * @tparam T The type of value being passed through Debounce.
 *
 * @param ms_min_delay The minimum amount of time that must have passed since
 * the input was received by this Transform in order for the output to occur. If
 * you are using this to debounce the output from `DigitalInputChange`,
 * ms_min_delay should be set at least a little bit longer than
 * `DigitalInputChange::read_delay`.
 *
 * DigitalInputChange::read_delay is 10 ms by default, and
 * Debounce::ms_min_delay is 15 ms by default. If that doesn't adequately
 * debounce your button or switch, adjust both of those values until it does.
 *
 * @param config_path The path for configuring ms_min_delay with the Config UI.
 * @see DigitalInputChange
