/**
 * @brief OBSOLETE: Since you can now apply an "output_scale" to the
 * AnalogInput sensor, you don't need this transform anymore. See the
 * description of "output_scale" in analog_input.h.
 *
 * A transform that does the opposite of what a physical voltage divider circuit
 * does: convert the voltage that comes out of a voltage divider back
 * into the original voltage that went into the voltage divider.
 *
 * Use case: measuring a ~12V DC source with an analog-to-digital converter
 * (ADC) that can take only 5V. You use a physical voltage divider circuit to
 * reduce from ~12V down to a range that's no higher than 5V. After you read the
 * output from the ADC and convert it into voltage, you have to reverse the
 * effect of the voltage divider circuit to know the original source voltage.
 *
 * @param R1 The value, in ohms, of R1 in your voltage divider circuit.
 *
 * @param R2 The value, in ohms, of R2 in your voltage divider circuit.
 *
 * For maximum accuracy, you should measure the actual ohms value of your
 * resistors, rather than just assuming they are as labeled.
