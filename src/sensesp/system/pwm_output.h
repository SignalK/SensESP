/**
 * @brief Provides a cross platform mechanism for generating
 * Pulse Width Modulation signals over one or more GPIO pins
 * on the MCU.
 * <p>This class works by defining a "PWM channel". GPIO pins
 * are assigned to a channel, and then the channel is used when
 * setting the pwm value. The pwm value is a float number between
 * 0.0 and 1.0, interpreted as a percentage of the maximum duty cycle
 * possible.
 * <p>Channels can be auto-assigned to a pin or they can be declared
 * explicitly in your code. The PWM value is set either by
 * calling `set_pwm()`, or by using an instance of `PWMOutput`
 * and calling the `set()` method as defined in `ValueConsumer<>`.
 * <p>On an esp32, the "channel" corresponds to one of the timer
 * channels available on the onboard chip.  Explicit declaration
 * of a channel may or may not be necessary depending on other
 * libraries that you may be using. Unless you have a need to use an
 * explicit channel (e.g. if some other software is already using
 * a particular esp32 timer channel), the channel auto-assign
 * feature is the easiest to use. In either event, using this
 * channel number allows the same code to work on either platform.
