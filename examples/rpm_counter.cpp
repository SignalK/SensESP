  // The "Signal K path" identifies the output of the sensor to the Signal K
  // network. If you have multiple sensors connected to your microcontoller
  // (ESP), each one of them will (probably) have its own Signal K path variable.
  // For example, if you have two propulsion engines, and you want the RPM of
  // each of them to go to Signal K, you might have sk_path_portEngine =
  // "propulsion.port.revolutions" and sk_path_starboardEngine =
  // "propulsion.starboard.revolutions" In this example, there is only one
  // propulsion engine, and its RPM is the only thing being reported to Signal K.

  // where configuration data is saved on the microcontroller.  It should
  // ALWAYS start with a forward slash if specified. If left blank,
  // that indicates this sensor or transform does not have any
  // configuration to save.
  // Note that if you want to be able to change the sk_path at runtime,
  // you will need to specify a configuration path.
  // As with the Signal K path, if you have multiple configurable sensors
  // connected to the microcontroller, you will have a configuration path
