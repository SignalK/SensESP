/*
  Illustrates a custom transform that takes a resistance value in ohms and returns the estimated
  temperature in Kelvin. Sample data in this example were taken from a Westerbeke generator
  temperature sender and gauge.
  Note that you will never instantiate CurveInterpolator in your own SensESP
  project - you will always need to create a descendant class of it, like
  TemperatureInterpreter in this example. The constructor needs to do only two things:
  call clearSamples(), then call addSample() at least twice. (This class can't function
  without at least two samples.) You can call addSample() as many times as you like,
  and the more samples you have, the more accurately this transform will emulate the
  analog sensor. Note, however, that since all transforms inherit from class
  Configurable, you can make its data configurable in the Config UI, and that means
  not only that you can edit (at runtime) whatever samples you add in the constructor,
  but also that you can add more samples at runtime.
  
  One of your samples should be at the lowest value for the input,and one should be at
  the highest value, so the input to CurveInterpolator will always be between two values.
   
  This example is a bit complex because of the need for the VoltageDivider2 transform,
  but that also makes it an excellent "advanced" example.

  /*
  Connecting a physical temperature sender to the MCU involves using a "voltage divider" circuit. 
  A resistor (R1) is connected to the voltage output of the board (3.3v or 5v, specified in Vin)
  to an intersection of two wires. One wire connects to the AnalogInput pin of the MCU, and the
  other wire connects to the sending unit doing the measurement. The sender is itself a variable
  resistor that is then connected to ground, forming the "R2" of a voltage divider circuit.
  The transform "VoltageDividerR2" takes a known voltage in (3.3 in this example), a known value
  for resistor R1 (51 ohms in this example), and based on the voltage read from AnalogInput,
  computes the resistance of the sender (R2), in ohms.
   
  One important point: the value of the output from the AnalogIn pin is not in volts, as 
  implied above. It's a value in the range 0 - 1023, and it represents the voltage in the range
  0.0V - 3.3V. But we need to send an actual voltage to VoltageDivider2(), which means we 
  need to first convert the value of AnalogInput to volts, which is done with AnalogVoltage().
   
  Although complex, this example pefectly illustrates the normal "chain" for getting a value
  from a sensor all the way to the SignalK server:
  - A real-world sensor sends its output to an input pin on the microcontroller
  - The value read from that pin gives us our actual input to the program. In this example,
    that's an AnalogInput().
  - That input is then sent through one or more transforms so that the end result is the value
    we want to send to SignalK. In this example, the transforms are AnalogVoltage(), then
    VoltageDivider2(), then TemperatureInterpreter(), then Linear().
  - Finally, the value we want is sent to the final "consumer", in this case SKOutputNumber().
  
  Notice the Linear() transport in the chain below. It's there in case you need to calibrate 
  the final output of your sensor, after it's gone through all the other transforms. For example,
  if you know your temperature sender always reports a temp that's about 5 degrees Fahrenheit
  too cold, you can calibrate its output here. A difference of 5 degrees F is a difference of
  2.78 degrees Kelvin, and all temps are sent to SignalK in Kelvin. So the Linear() below 
  would be Linear(1.0, 2.78, "gen/temp/calibrate") - 1.0 is the multiplier (so it does nothing),
  and 2.78 is the offset, so it's added to the output of TemperatureInterpreter() just before
  the value is sent to SignalK. ("gen/temp/calibrate" tells the Config UI how to display it.)
